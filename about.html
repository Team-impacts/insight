            MENTOR : Sampath Kumar S (THEME: Open Innovation)
            PROBLEM STATEMENT : Addressing the challenge of fostering positive behavior in educational
            institutions, Need a solution that promotes a culture of respect and accountability among students,
            teachers, and parents, leading to a disciplined and harmonious learning environment.
            Introduction:
            We introduce an app like social media designed to improve manners among college students. It
            helps students, teachers, and parents communicate better and encourages good behavior on campus.
            Methodology:
            "Insight" lets teachers talk privately with students and parents about behavior issues while praising
            good behavior publicly. It also gives students points and badges for being polite.
            Features:
            Reporting System: Teachers can privately address behavior problems with students and parents.
            Public Acknowledgment: Good behavior is publicly recognized, fostering a supportive environment.
            Manner Points and Badges: Students earn points and badges for tracking their progress.
            Upvotes and Downvotes: Students receive upvotes for displaying mannerism and downvotes for
            disciplinary issues.
            Results:
            Using "Insight" has improved manners on campus. Students know what's expected, and teachers
            can address problems discreetly. Everyone feels encouraged to behave well.
            Conclusion:
            "Insight" helps build a respectful and accountable community in schools. It's easy to use and brings
            students, teachers, and parents together.
            Impact:
            "Insight" has made campuses more disciplined and boosting student well-being and academic success. By
            encouraging good behavior, it creates a better learning environment for everyone.
            Technology Stacks:
            "Insight" uses Figma for prototyping and Flutterflow for app development with help of firebase for data
            management. These tools make it easy and affordable to design and build the app, ensuring compatibility
            across different devices and systems for user accessibility.</p>
